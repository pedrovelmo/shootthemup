 * Callout(**Space**):
 In the 23rd century, the human race developed the technology to travel beyond our solar system and explore other galaxies. When the starship USS Intrepid reached the 2.0 Beta Quadrant, where no one has gone before, they encountered the Thelonians, an evil alien race that wants to rule the universe. Fearing that the earthlings will spoil their insidious plans, the Thelonians started an attack on Earth, launching several asteroids to its orbit. Now, it is up to the USS Intrepid to stop them, before it is too late.
